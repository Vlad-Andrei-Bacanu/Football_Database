Ghapama (Armenian: ) is an Armenian stuffed pumpkin dish, often prepared during the Christmas season. It is prepared by removing the guts of the pumpkin (known as  in Armenian, pronounced dt'um in Eastern Armenian and t't'um in Western Armenian) and stuffing it with boiled rice and dried fruits such as chopped almonds, apple, cornel, apricot, plums, dates, prunes and raisins. It is also common to pour on honey and mix in ground cinnamon or sugar. The pumpkin is then baked until it becomes soft, then brought to the table where it is cut up and served.
There is an Armenian song about the meal known as    (Hey Jan Ghapama), popularized by Harout Pamboukjian.
